Tale</h1><blockquote><p>üß≥ Need a quick summary? Check out our <a href="/aberabook/community/tokenomics/tokenomics-tldr">Tokenomics TL;DR (Too Long; Didn&#x27;t Read)</a>.</p></blockquote><p>In the vast ocean of decentralized finance, many token launches have struggled to find their bearings. Like inexperienced swimmers in choppy waters, projects often faced challenges that left both founders and community members treading water. üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p><p>Low float launches, like small ponds, offered little room for big fish to swim. Market manipulation was rampant, with whales easily making waves that disrupted entire ecosystems. Finding true value was like searching for a pearl in murky waters.</p><p>High and full float launches weren&#x27;t much better. Launching all tokens at once often caused chaos, like dropping all the fish into the sea simultaneously. A few large predators dominated these ecosystems, and with all tokens released at once, there was little incentive for long-term participation.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos in the Crypto Sea" src="/aberabook/assets/images/chaos-53552493dab145ea468c687d83401bbe.jpg" width="1280" height="426" class="img_ev3q"></p><span class="image-caption">Chaos in the Crypto Sea</span><p>These traditional models left many projects and their communities feeling like they were swimming against the tide. The need for a better way became clear ‚Äì a method that could provide smooth sailing for all participants in the vast ocean of crypto. üö¢</p><p>As the crypto seas grew more turbulent, a group of innovative Beras heard the call of the wild. The placid pools of traditional tokenomics were drying up, leaving many crypto creatures high and dry. It was time for a change. Time to make a splash.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A New Hope: Beras Envisioning a Revolutionary Tokenomics Model" src="/aberabook/assets/images/clear-streams-69a9d83e4b3bfb191eadd5fcd9a5b70a.jpg" width="1280" height="426" class="img_ev3q"></p><span class="image-caption">A New Hope: Beras Envisioning a Revolutionary Tokenomics Model.</span><p>Enter AquaBera. üí¶</p><p>With the wisdom of the tides and the strength of the current, AquaBera envisioned a new kind of tokenomics. A model as fluid as water itself, adapting to the ebb and flow of the market. No more stagnant pools of locked tokens. No more tsunamis of sudden unlocks threatening to wash away value.</p><p>But such a journey would not be easy. The Beras knew they needed guides, masters of the crypto currents.</p><p>From the misty peaks of innovation came Amplifi, the Master Currentologist.

With steady paws and a nose for the perfect blend, Aegis would ensure that every $JUG contained just the right amount of sweetness to weather any storm.</p><p>Together, they set out to create not just a token, but an entire aquatic ecosystem. A place where every Bera, big or small, could swim freely and flourish. Where the tides of trading fees would nourish the pools, and where patience would be rewarded with the sweetest honey.</p><p>The journey ahead was long, the seas untested. But with determination in their hearts and a vision of a fairer, more sustainable DeFi ocean, the Beras of AquaBera took their first bold splash into the unknown.</p><p>As our brave Beras dipped their paws into the uncharted waters of innovative tokenomics, they knew they were about to make a splash heard &#x27;round the crypto world. It was time to dive deep into the heart of their creation: the Dynamic Full Float (DFF).</p><p>Picture, if you will, a vast, crystal-clear lagoon. This is no ordinary pool, mind you. This is the birthplace of $SIP and $JUG, the twin currents that would power the entire AquaBera ecosystem.</p><p>$SIP, as fluid and essential as water itself, represents the lifeblood of liquidity. All 75 million $SIPs, enough to quench the thirst of a million Beras, plunged into the pool at once. No holding back, no timid toe-dipping. This was a cannonball of liquidity that sent ripples across the DeFi seas.</p><p>But wait! Wouldn&#x27;t such a massive splash cause a tidal wave of volatility? üåä</p><p>Enter the ingenious $JUG. Like a magical water jug that never runs dry, each $JUG holds the promise of future $SIPs. Patient Beras who hold their $JUGs might find them growing heavier with sweet, sweet liquidity over time. It&#x27;s as if the very tides themselves were filling these jugs, rewarding those with the wisdom to wait.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Aegis: The Keeper of $HONEY" src="/aberabook/assets/images/aegis-0434d064b5dc6b59de328c97d0aaf817.jpg" width="1280" height="426" class="img_ev3q"></p><span class="image-caption">Aegis: The Keeper of $HONEY</span><p>Amplifi, our Master Currentologist, stood at the edge of this newfound lagoon, their eyes twinkling with excitement. With deft movements, they began to chart the currents, ensuring that every ripple and wave served a purpose. Their expertise shaped the DFF into a model of efficiency, where every drop of liquidity worked as hard as a Bera preparing for winter.</p><p>As the $SIPs swirled and the $JUGs bobbed gently in the waters, a remarkable thing began to happen. The lagoon seemed to come alive, pulsing with an energy never before seen in the world of tokenomics. It was deep enough for whales to swim freely, yet gentle enough for even the smallest fish to feel safe.</p><p>Our Beras stood in awe at the edge of their creation. They had done it. They had crossed the threshold into a new era of tokenomics. The Dynamic Full Float was no longer just a dream‚Äîit was a living, breathing ecosystem.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The Birth of Dynamic Full Float (DFF)" src="/aberabook/assets/images/dff-ee684766418c0f70c598b527f128b242.jpg" width="1280" height="426" class="img_ev3q"></p><span class="image-caption">The Birth of Dynamic Full Float (DFF)</span><p>With the Dynamic Full Float lagoon shimmering before them, our intrepid Beras knew that creating the pool was just the beginning. Now came the true test: building a thriving ecosystem that could weather any storm the crypto seas might throw their way.</p><p>As if summoned by the splashing of innovation, new challenges emerged from the depths. Market volatility, that great kraken of the crypto world, reared its ugly head. Its tentacles of FUD threatened to stir up tsunamis that could wash away even the most steadfast projects. üêô</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Amplifi and Aegis Tame the Kraken of Volatility" src="/aberabook/assets/images/kraken-4561eb0cccb4a0dbd60a95c99cffe7f9.jpg" width="1280" height="426" class="img_ev3q"></p><span class="image-caption">Amplifi and Aegis Tame the Kraken of Volatility</span><p>But our Beras were not alone in facing these trials. From the golden hives perched on the cliffs overlooking their lagoon came a buzz of activity. Aegis, the Keeper of $HONEY, was on the move.</p><p>With the precision of a master alchemist, Aegis began its work. Into each $JUG, it added just the right amount of $HONEY ‚Äì Berachain&#x27;s own liquid gold. Not too much to make the waters sickly sweet, not too little to lose its stabilizing properties. Just the perfect blend to give each $JUG the strength to ride out even the roughest waves.</p><p>&quot;Too much $HONEY and we&#x27;ll attract bears of a different kind,&quot; Aegis warned with a wink. &quot;Too little, and our Beras might find the waters a bit too... unbearable.&quot; üçØ</p><p>As Aegis worked its magic, it revealed another trick up its furry sleeve. Two magnificent vaults emerged from the mist ‚Äì each a mirror image of the other. With deft paws, Aegis began to sort the ecosystem&#x27;s assets, creating a perfect balance between stability and growth.</p><p>&quot;Behold,&quot; Aegis proclaimed, &quot;the twin vaults of liquidity! One for calm waters, one for riding the waves. Together, they shall keep our ecosystem as steady as a Bera on a log, yet as nimble as a fish in a stream.&quot;</p><p>But the true strength of the AquaBera ecosystem didn&#x27;t lie just in its innovative design or its powerful allies. As word spread of this new oasis in the DeFi desert, more and more crypto creatures were drawn to its waters.</p><p>A school of fish, representing the community of traders and holders, began to swim in harmonious patterns through the lagoon. Each movement, each trade, added to the vibrancy of the ecosystem. Small fish found protection in the deeper liquidity, while larger ones reveled in the freedom to maneuver without causing massive waves. üêüüê†üê°</p><p>&quot;Look!&quot; cried one of the Beras, pointing excitedly. &quot;It&#x27;s working! Our ecosystem is coming to life!&quot;</p><p>And indeed it was. The waters pulsed with activity, yet remained remarkably stable. The $JUGs bobbed happily, growing heavier with promise by the day. Aegis&#x27;s $HONEY blend kept the waters sweet and inviting, while Amplifi&#x27;s currents ensured that every drop of liquidity was put to good use.</p><p>The day had finally arrived. The sun peeked over the horizon, casting a golden glow across the AquaBera lagoon. Our Beras stood at the shore, a mix of excitement and nervousness rippling through their fur. Today was the day they would open the floodgates and connect their carefully crafted ecosystem to the vast, unpredictable ocean of the crypto market.</p><p>Amplifi, the Master Currentologist, gave a solemn nod. &quot;It&#x27;s time,&quot; they said, paw hovering over the launch button. &quot;May the currents be ever in our favor.&quot;</p><p>With a deep breath and a collective paw-crossing from the Beras, Amplifi pressed the button. The lagoon&#x27;s waters surged, and a massive wave carried the $SIPs and $JUGs out into the open sea. üåäüèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p><p>For a moment, all was calm. Then, like a sudden squall, trading activity exploded.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Aquabera Makes Waves" src="/aberabook/assets/images/launch-b0f4a2d75abd753a8729768a8baf1daa.jpg" width="1280" height="426" class="img_ev3q"></p><span class="image-caption">Aquabera Makes Waves</span><p>Buy orders crashed against sell walls like waves against a cliff. The price of $SIP bobbed up and down, riding swells of demand and dipping into troughs of profit-taking. Traders from all corners of the crypto world descended upon AquaBera, their transactions sending ripples across the newly formed markets.</p><p>&quot;Hold steady!&quot; cried one of the Beras, clinging to a floating $JUG. &quot;Remember, our Dynamic Full Float was built for this!&quot;</p><p>And indeed, as the initial frenzy began to subside, something remarkable became apparent. Where other projects might have been tossed about like driftwood in a storm, AquaBera&#x27;s waters remained remarkably... well, bearable.</p><p>The full liquidity deployment of $SIP tokens acted like a deep, stabilizing current beneath the choppy surface. Massive buy or sell orders that might have caused tsunamis in shallower pools were absorbed with barely a splash.</p><p>Aegis, ever-vigilant, kept a close eye on the $HONEY levels in each $JUG. As some traders eagerly uncorked their $JUGs for a taste of that sweet, sweet liquidity, Aegis ensured the remaining $JUGs grew even more potent. Patient Beras who held onto their $JUGs found them growing heavier with unredeemed $SIPs, a reward for their steadfast faith in the ecosystem.</p><p>As the day wore on, the true strength of the AquaBera model began to shine. The price discovered its natural level not through violent swings, but through a smooth, gradual process. It was as if the entire market was learning to swim in harmony with AquaBera&#x27;s innovative currents.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Smooth Sailing" src="/aberabook/assets/images/peace-4cb1e27e3322bd87115b312146ba9921.jpg" width="1280" height="426" class="img_ev3q"></p><span class="image-caption">Smooth Sailing</span><p>Amplifi watched the charts with a knowing smile. &quot;See how the currents flow?&quot; they mused. &quot;No stagnant pools of locked tokens, no sudden floods of unlocks. Just a steady, sustainable stream of liquidity.&quot;</p><p>But the ordeal was not without its heart-stopping moments. A whale, attracted by the commotion, decided to make a massive splash. It dumped a sizeable portion of $SIPs into the market, expecting to see the price plummet.</p><p>The Beras held their breath... but the expected crash never came. The Aegis vaults sprang into action, their dual-sided liquidity provision absorbing the shock. The price dipped, yes, but like a buoy pushed underwater, it bobbed right back up.</p><p>As the sun began to set on launch day, our exhausted but exhilarated Beras gathered once more at the shore of their lagoon. The waters, now thoroughly mixed with the wider crypto seas, sparkled with vitality and promise.</p><p>&quot;We did it,&quot; whispered one Bera, awe in their voice. &quot;We really did it.&quot;</p><p>Indeed they had. AquaBera had faced the ordeal of its market launch and emerged not just afloat, but swimming strong. The Dynamic Full Float model had proven its worth, standing firm against the very challenges that had sunk so many projects before.</p><p>As the dust settled on AquaBera&#x27;s triumphant launch, the crypto world watched in awe as a new era of tokenomics began to unfold. Our brave Beras, once mere visionaries paddling against the current of traditional models, now found themselves riding the crest of a revolutionary wave.</p><p>The benefits of their Dynamic Full Float approach began to crystallize, clear as the waters of their beloved lagoon.</p><p>First and foremost, liquidity. Oh, the liquidity! üåä</p><p>Where other projects&#x27; trading pools were as shallow as a bear&#x27;s paw print, AquaBera&#x27;s liquidity ran deep and true. Traders frolicked in waters so deep and welcoming, they scarcely remembered the drought-stricken puddles of low-float tokens.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s like swimming in a vast ocean,&quot; one trader marveled, executing a hefty buy order with nary a ripple in the price. &quot;No more fear of beaching myself on a sandbar of slippage!&quot;</p><p>But the true magic lay in the ever-filling $JUGs. As impatient traders uncorked their $JUGs early, patient Beras watched with glee as their own vessels grew heavier with unclaimed $SIPs. It was as if the very tides themselves were rewarding those who understood the ebb and flow of the market.</p><p>Aegis, our steadfast keeper of $HONEY, nodded approvingly as the ecosystem maintained its perfect balance. &quot;Sweet enough to attract, strong enough to endure,&quot; they hummed, mixing another batch of perfectly balanced $JUGs.</p><p>The dual vaults, Aegis&#x27;s masterpiece, worked tirelessly in the background. They diversified the project&#x27;s treasury without undermining its liquidity strength ‚Äì a feat once thought as impossible as a Bera sprouting wings. </p><p>As weeks turned to months, the benefits of AquaBera&#x27;s approach became impossible to ignore:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Crystal Clear Liquidity Pools</strong> üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
No more murky waters of uncertainty. Traders and investors alike reveled in the transparency and depth of AquaBera&#x27;s liquidity.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Rising Tide Lifts All Beras</strong> üêªüåÖ
The community thrived, bonded by their shared stake in the ecosystem&#x27;s success. From the smallest minnow to the largest whale, all found their place in AquaBera&#x27;s welcoming waters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sustainable Growth in the Crypto Ocean</strong> üå±üåä
Unlike the boom-and-bust cycles of yesteryear, AquaBera fostered steady, sustainable growth. The constant influx of trading fees nourished the ecosystem, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of prosperity.</p></li></ol><p>As AquaBera&#x27;s success story spread through the crypto currents, our innovative Beras found themselves no longer swimming against the tide, but leading a veritable flotilla of change. The road back from their grand adventure was paved with influence, as projects far and wide began to take notice of the Dynamic Full Float model.</p><p>Word traveled fast in the DeFi seas. From the frothy waters of meme tokens to the deep, still pools of blue-chip projects, whispers of AquaBera&#x27;s revolutionary approach echoed.</p><p>&quot;Have you heard?&quot; the gossip flowed. &quot;There&#x27;s a new way to launch, a way that&#x27;s fair for all fish in the sea!&quot;</p><p>Amplifi, our Master Currentologist, suddenly found their flippers full. Their expertise, once dismissed as a dreamer&#x27;s folly, was now in hot demand. Projects lined up like salmon swimming upstream, all eager to learn the secrets of the Dynamic Full Float.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s not just about making a splash,&quot; Amplifi would explain to wide-eyed founders. &quot;It&#x27;s about creating an entire ecosystem that can weather any storm.&quot;</p><p>As Amplifi shared their wisdom, a new wave of token launches began to take shape across the DeFi landscape. Gone were the days of shallow liquidity pools and token supplies locked tighter than a clam at high tide. In their place, deep, vibrant pools of liquidity emerged, teeming with possibility.</p><p>Aegis, too, found its unique approach to treasury management gaining traction. The dual vault strategy, once seen as complex as a coral reef, was now being adopted by projects looking to diversify without sacrificing liquidity strength.</p><p>&quot;Balance,&quot; Aegis would buzz to attentive audiences, &quot;is the key to a sweet and stable ecosystem.&quot; üçØ‚öñÔ∏è</p><p>But it wasn&#x27;t just the mechanics of AquaBera&#x27;s model that were making waves. The very philosophy behind it ‚Äì one of fairness, sustainability, and community empowerment ‚Äì began to permeate the DeFi zeitgeist.</p><p>Traders who once hunted for quick gains in turbulent waters now spoke of &quot;swimming with the current&quot; and &quot;riding the long wave.&quot; Communities, inspired by AquaBera&#x27;s thriving ecosystem, began to demand more from their projects. They wanted more than just tokens; they wanted to be part of something sustainable, something revolutionary.</p><p>As the influence spread, our Beras watched with a mix of pride and awe. They had set out to change their own little corner of the crypto ocean, but now found themselves at the forefront of a sea change in DeFi thinking.</p><p>Yet, with great influence came great responsibility. As more eyes turned to AquaBera for guidance, our Beras realized their journey was far from over. They had shown the world a new path, but now they needed to light the way forward.</p><p>Challenges still lurked in the depths. How could they ensure that projects adopting their model did so with the same commitment to community and sustainability? How could they continue to innovate in a landscape that was quickly catching up to their once-revolutionary ideas?</p><p>As the crypto tides turned and seasons changed, AquaBera&#x27;s influence continued to grow, breathing new life into the once stagnant waters of tokenomics. What had begun as a bold experiment by a group of visionary Beras had blossomed into a full-fledged revolution, reshaping the very foundations of how projects approached token launches and ecosystem building.</p><p>In this new era, the Dynamic Full Float (DFF) model stood as a shining lighthouse, guiding projects through the foggy seas of token distribution and liquidity management. But our innovative Beras knew that true progress meant more than just replication ‚Äì it meant evolution.</p><p>Amplifi, ever the forward-thinker, gathered the AquaBera team for a moonlit strategy session by the lagoon&#x27;s edge. &quot;My fellow Beras,&quot; they began, eyes twinkling like starlight on water, &quot;we&#x27;ve changed the game, but the game never stops changing. What wonders might the future hold?&quot;</p><p>And so, with the curiosity of cubs exploring a new stream, they began to ponder the possibilities that lay ahead.</p><p>Could the currents of tokenomics one day flow as naturally and effortlessly as a mountain stream? Might liquidity pools grow and shrink with the seasons, like the ebb and flow of tides? The Beras wondered if a day would come when participating in DeFi would be as natural to humans as swimming is to fish.</p><p>They dreamed of ecosystems as intricate and harmonious as coral reefs, where projects large and small could thrive together in perfect balance. Perhaps, they mused, the future would bring ways for different blockchain islands to build bridges, allowing value to flow as freely as water between oceans.</p><p>Aegis, our steadfast guardian of balance, gazed thoughtfully into the distance. &quot;The sweetest honey,&quot; they buzzed softly, &quot;comes from flowers we have yet to discover.&quot; The others nodded, understanding that the greatest innovations often lie just beyond the horizon of our current imagination.</p><p>As the night wore on, their wonderings grew bolder. Could there one day be a universal language of value, as clear and understood as the songs whales sing across vast oceans? Might we see the birth of financial ecosystems that adapt and evolve in real-time, as responsive to change as a school of fish darting through sunlit waters?</p><p>The possibilities seemed as endless as the stars reflected in their beloved lagoon. Yet, for all their dreaming, our Beras knew that the future, like the deepest ocean trenches, held mysteries they could scarcely fathom.</p><p>As the first light of dawn began to paint the sky, our Beras stood paw-in-paw at the water&#x27;s edge. They had resurrected not just a model, but an entire philosophy of how value could be created, distributed, and grown in the digital age. And in doing so, they had opened the floodgates to a future brimming with potential.</p><p>The once-stagnant pools of traditional finance had been transformed into a vibrant, ever-flowing river of innovation and opportunity. And at its heart, AquaBera continued to swim, always pushing forward, always seeking the next current of change.</p><p>As the first rays of sunlight sparkled across the AquaBera lagoon, our band of intrepid Beras found themselves back where their journey began. But they were no longer the same wide-eyed dreamers who had first set out to revolutionize tokenomics. They had returned, bearing the precious elixir of knowledge and experience, ready to share their wisdom with the entire DeFi community.</p><p>Gathering on the shore, surrounded by the thriving ecosystem they had created, each Bera took a moment to reflect on the lessons they had learned - lessons as valuable as the sweetest honey, as deep as the ocean itself.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Lessons Like Sweet Honey" src="/aberabook/assets/images/end-d939359c4358c21ea9f36a3d40ea46f1.jpg" width="1280" height="426" class="img_ev3q"></p><span class="image-caption">Lessons Like Sweet Honey</span><p>Amplifi, the Master Currentologist, stepped forward first. &quot;Friends,&quot; they began, their voice carrying across the gentle waves, &quot;we&#x27;ve learned that true innovation isn&#x27;t about making the biggest splash, but about creating currents that lift all boats. Our Dynamic Full Float model showed us that when liquidity flows freely, everyone benefits.&quot;</p><p>Aegis, the Keeper of $HONEY, nodded sagely. &quot;Balance,&quot; they buzzed, &quot;is the key to a healthy ecosystem. Like the perfect blend of $HONEY in each $JUG, projects must find harmony between growth and stability, between rewarding early believers and ensuring long-term sustainability.&quot;</p><p>One of the younger Beras, eyes shining with newfound understanding, chimed in. &quot;We&#x27;ve seen that patience is more than a virtue - it&#x27;s a strategy! Our $JUG holders taught us that in DeFi, slow and steady doesn&#x27;t just win the race, it helps build a better race track for everyone.&quot;</p><p>A murmur of agreement rippled through the group. Another Bera spoke up, &quot;And let&#x27;s not forget the power of community! We&#x27;re stronger together, like a school of fish moving as one. When we aligned the interests of all participants - from the smallest minnow to the largest whale - we created something truly special.&quot;</p><p>As each Bera shared their insights, the elixir of their collective wisdom seemed to shimmer in the morning air. But perhaps the most profound lesson came from the eldest Bera, who had watched their dream grow from a tiny ripple to a tidal wave of change.</p><p>&quot;My dear Beras,&quot; the elder said, their voice soft yet filled with conviction, &quot;our greatest lesson is this: the future is not set in stone, but fluid like water. We must be ready to adapt, to flow around obstacles, to carve new paths when necessary. Our journey doesn&#x27;t end here - in fact, it&#x27;s only just beginning.&quot;</p><p>As the sun climbed higher, casting its warm glow across the lagoon, our Beras realized that the true elixir they carried wasn&#x27;t just their innovative model or their successful launch. It was the spirit of curiosity, the courage to challenge the status quo, and the commitment to creating a fairer, more sustainable DeFi ecosystem for all.</p><p>They had returned with more than just lessons - they had brought back hope. Hope for a future where tokenomics could be a force for good, where communities could thrive, and where the rising tide of innovation truly lifted all boats.</p><p>As they looked out across the vast expanse of the crypto seas, they knew that their journey had impacts far beyond their own project. They had inspired others to dream, to innovate, to seek better ways of doing things. The ripples of their adventure would continue to spread, touching distant shores and inspiring new explorers for years to come.</p><p>And so, as our story comes to a close, we find our Beras not ending their journey, but embarking on a new chapter. For in the ever-flowing rivers of DeFi, there are always new currents to navigate, new depths to explore, and new horizons to chase.</p><p>They dove back into their beloved waters, ready to face whatever challenges the future might bring. For they knew now, more than ever, that in the vast ocean of possibility, there will always be room for brave Beras with big dreams and bigger hearts.</p><p>And as for you, dear reader? Perhaps you too have been inspired to make your own splash in the world of DeFi. Remember the lessons of AquaBera, stay curious, be patient, and above all, never stop swimming towards your dreams.</p><p>For in the end, we&#x27;re all just Beras in a great big digital ocean, trying to make waves that matter. üåäüêªüíñ</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/labs-solo/aberabook/edit/main/docusaurus/docs/community/tokenomics/tokenomics.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Contribute to this page on GitHub</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/aberabook/community/intro"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Introduction to the AquaBera Community</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/aberabook/community/tokenomics/tokenomics-tldr"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">AquaBera Tokenomics: TL;DR üìä</div></a></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">AquaBera Documentation</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/aberabook/user-docs/intro">User Guide</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/aberabook/dev-docs/intro">Developer Documentation</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/aberabook/user-docs/faq">FAQ</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/aberabook/community/tokenomics">Tokenomics</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/aberabook/community/socials">Socials</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/aberabook/community/forum">Forum</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discord.aquabera.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/aquabera" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Developer Resources</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/aberabook/dev-docs/deployed-contracts">Deployed Contracts</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/aberabook/dev-docs/audits">Audits</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/labs-solo/aberabook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://aquabera.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/aberabook/about-us">About Us</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/aberabook/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright ¬© 2024 AquaBera.
